# System Programming and Compiler Construction Experiments

This repository contains experiments related to concepts in system programming and compiler construction.

## Experiments Covered

* **Experiment 1: Lexical Analysis** 
   - Implementation of a lexical analyzer (or scanner) to tokenize a given input source code.
* **Experiment 2: Parse Tree Construction**
   - Construction of a parse tree using a suitable parsing technique (e.g., top-down or bottom-up parsing).

## Technologies Used

* [Programming Language] (Provide the specific language used for development)
* [Lexical Analyzer Tool (If applicable)] 
* [Parser Generator Tool (If applicable)]
